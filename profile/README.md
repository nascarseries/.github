The final four drivers emerged from a 16-driver playoff field and navigated nine playoff races to reach this point. Logano, Reddick and Blaney each won a race in the third round to advance to the championship, while Byron secured his position on points.

Blaney, the defending series champion, and Logano, a two-time Cup Series champ, drive for Team Penske and can bring the organization its third consecutive title. Byron, who drives for Hendrick Motorsports, and Reddick, who drives for 23XI Racing, are each seeking their first Cup championship.
